# Networking-Coursework
This is the networking coursework that I carried out at university


This is a piece of software that was created at University for my coursework in the networking and user interfact design module

The program contains 2 solutions

1 solution is a basic location server that uses the whois domain at Hull university to show locations of certain users in the system

The other solution is a basic client with a very basic user interface that connects to the server and pulls up the location of a requested user or item.

If the item does not exist then the user can put a new location and it will be added to a dictionary that has the key of user and definition of location
